# Govdirectory

Govdirectory aims to become a global directory of government agencies and their online presence by utilizing Wikidata.
Wikidatas community, sourceability, versioning, and potential custom tooling that we create will ensure that not only should the information be correct but when it isn't, because of vandalism or something else, users will be able, and suggested, to validate the information.
The goal is for this directory to be useful to journalists, web-archivists, researchers and many others, certainly including regular citizens.

## How you can help

- You can already help the project by improving data about public agencies on [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org). Not only do we need all of them added, we also need to be able to differentiate active ones (in contrast to historic agencies). Other basic properties we need are in which country they operate and the online platforms they are on. If possible, and/or relevant, make clear which administrative level they are on (state, regional, local etc.) or what type of agency it is (like environmental protection or taxes).
- You can also help by [telling us](https://github.com/govdirectory/website/discussions) how you would like to use a resource like this.
